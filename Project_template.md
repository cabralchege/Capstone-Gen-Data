## Project Description
- This project explores how geothermal potential correlates with infrastructure, population growth, and power demand, revealing insights that can guide energy policy and investment decisions

## What is the problem you are solving?
### Businesses or your audience care about problems. Make the problem clear and relatable
- Kenya’s national power grid and by extension, its economy and the cost of electricity for citizens is vulnerable to two major shocks:
1. Unpredictable rainfall, which affects hydroelectric generation.
2. Volatile global fuel prices, which increase the cost of thermal power generation.
## What tools did you use?
Python? GeoPanadas? Google Big Query?
1. Python
2. SQL
3. Tableau
## Tell your audience how you got the answer,  tools show your capability
### Dive deep in this in your technical  article
- 

## What insights did you or do you want to discover? What Solutions do you want to offer? Do People even need these solutions?
### Don’t just say “dashboard done.”
### Share the “aha!” moments, they matter more that the visuals
1. Geothermal is Kenya’s Most Reliable Power Source
While hydropower fluctuates dramatically during droughts, geothermal generation remains constant year-round.
2. Fuel Price Shocks Have a Reduced Impact
Even when global oil prices spike, Kenya’s thermal generation contribution declines as geothermal capacity increases.
3. Energy Mix Has Shifted Toward Clean Power
In 2010, geothermal provided ~15% of Kenya’s electricity; by 2025, it contributes over 45%, displacing fossil-based generation.
4. Power Prices Are Becoming More Stable
Electricity tariffs (industrial and residential) show reduced volatility after 2016, when new Olkaria units came online.
5️. Climate & Carbon Impact

How would a business or a community (for Social Impact Projects) benefit from your work?
Be specific. Think money saved, process improves, better decisions made
That’s your real value
