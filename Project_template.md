Project Description



What is the problem you are solving?
Businesses or your audience care about problems. Make the problem clear and relatable

- This project explores how geothermal potential correlates with infrastructure, population growth, and power demand, revealing insights that can guide energy policy and investment decisions
- Kenya’s national power grid and by extension, its economy and the cost of electricity for citizens is vulnerable to two major shocks:
1. Unpredictable rainfall, which affects hydroelectric generation.
2. Volatile global fuel prices, which increase the cost of thermal power generation.
What tools did you use?
Python? GeoPanadas? Google Big Query?
Tell your audience how you got the answer,  tools show your capability
Dive deep in this in your technical  article
- 

What insights did you or do you want to discover? What Solutions do you want to offer? Do People even need these solutions?
Don’t just say “dashboard done.”
Share the “aha!” moments, they matter more that the visuals

How would a business or a community (for Social Impact Projects) benefit from your work?

That’s your real value
